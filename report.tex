\section{Description of prototype functionality}
\subsection{Background}
The Internet, since its inception, has been a basis for information and knowledge sharing. With the advent of the Web in the last two decades it has also become increasingly interactive. This increasing amount of interactivity started out with Usenet newsgroups, the IRC and discussion groups which were (and still are) very popular especially among technology people. The ease of use of web tools and the widespread adoption of the PC and the World Wide Web has made the average user able to interact easily through the Web and the last few years transformed him from a mere consumer of information to a consumer/publisher of information through the use of blogs, social networking sites.  This led to the creation of themed online-communities allowing people to interact and share knowledge on just about any topic. Especially popular though are technology related communities such as discussion forums for a specific topic(ubuntu users etc.) or question-answer based websites (stack overflow).

We have found, through our university experience, that we rely heavily on user-generated information sharing websites such as Wikipedia, blogs or question-answer websites(which often involve discussion) for our work. Also the use of social networking sites for communication(primarily) and information sharing in the University environment -either among group members for a specific coursework, students in a specific course or society- has become a de facto standard. Our aim was the creation of a web application targeted at students of our department (ECS) that combined characteristics of question-answer based websites(best answer, user reputation), the interactivity offered by Facebook groups for communication and information sharing and also some form module exploration(module-specific information that do not show up at the Syllabus) for lower-year students that would assist in the module selection process.
\subsection{Prototype}
Our application tries to bridge the gap between information sharing websites and Facebook groups by providing a way to do both through a forum-like interface.  Registered users can subscribe to different modules to see module-specific posts. They can also create their own threads for discussion/question asking or reply to threads created by other users. Threads and replies can be up-voted and down-voted by users. Highly rated replies/threads as shown first or higher in the presentation of a thread.  Users with a big number of highly rated posts get a higher reputation(karma).

The functionality of the application is extended by allowing the users to rate modules, courseworks and lecturers. Users can also add their grade for the module thus creating module specific statistics which provide a body of knowledge passed from year to year, information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain and which facilitate module selection.

\section{Tools and techniques used}
 \begin{description}
  \item[Emacs, vim, notepad++] \hfill \\
  These text editors were used for writing code.(you don't say)
  \item[Git] \hfill \\
  Git is a distributed version control and source-code management system. Developing with version control has many advantages especially in collaborative projects. It allows for tracking of changes per user, reverting back to previous versions, branching to test experimental features. 
  \item[Github] \hfill \\
  Github is a free and open-source web-based project hosting service that uses the Git version control system.  It provides a nice graphical interface to git repositories by allowing you to see coloured diffs, repository history, changes by user, relevant statistics of contribution, discussion by commit comments. It also provides hosting so it can be used as a central copy(master) of the repository for backup and reference. It also provides 'wiki' functionality for each project.
\item[Facebook] \hfill \\
  A facebook group was created for internal communication and discussion between members of the group. 
\item[Google Docs] \hfill \\
  Google docs were used for more formal and persistent communication of ideas, tasks to be done and requirements. It allows for collaborative live editing, a feature that proved very useful.

\section{Overview of design and implementation}
Our main design philosophy was to create an easy to use forum-like interface that also has the characteristics of other online-communities or question/answer websites with the notion of measuring the importance or usefulness of answers based on user ratings. It also had to be tailored to the needs of students of our department by providing user generated module information. We felt that these two requirements were what had be the starting point for all our design decisions as these were the features that would set our application apart from alternatives and also make it attractive to students. The main design decisions regarded the back-end, namely the database and what was going to be stored and how to suit our needs, and the front-end, how the informations was going to be presented to the user in a nice way.

For the presentation part we took ideas from other online-communities websites which had the notion of importance of posts based on user ratings like 'reddit' or 'stack overflow'.  We wanted to emphasize the interactivity and discussion aspect of each topic or thread raised so we decided that users can either reply to a specific thread/question directly or reply to another user's reply. Replying to another reply indents the post thus creating sub-threads or sub-discussions which are easily recognizable from the presentation. Also to accommodate our other requirement of posts rating, the rating of posts affects their position in the thread. Higher-rated replies are deemed more interesting or helpful and are higher up in the reply hierarchy and therefore more visible to readers of the thread. For our other goal, that of module exploration, the user-generated statistics for each module are shown on top of each module specific page along with traditional module information like lecturers and coursework deadline information.

For the back-end we used the Datastore facilities as provided by Google App Engine to accommodate all the necessary information and entities interactions. We again looked at our main requirements to shape the design of the database and also drawn from our personal experience or what we thought might be useful. The main challenge here was to keep track of the reply hierarchy needed for the correct indented presentation of the threads.
