Should we have an admin page ?

kim-dio-kim :
	modules list could be a dropdown
	
	user profile : modules should pop up a window and show :
		link to the intranet page of that module
		lecture schedule
		deadlines
		syllabus
		lecturer evaluations ?
		what are the pictures ?
	
	in homepage :
		position latest topics to the left, show deadline instead
		have a link to the user profile
	
	on module page:
		clicking on a lecturer would lead to evaluation of the lecturer/view comments on them
	
	Forum page is not really required, as everything could be accessible through the user profile
