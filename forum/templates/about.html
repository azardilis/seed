			<p>It is the year 2012 and this is Scripting Team K and this is our coursework for the year 2012/2013 for the module COMP3001-Scripting Languages.</p>
			<p>This forum application resides on Google Appengine, and is written in Python 2.7 and Javascript.</p>

			<h3>The concept</h3>
			<p>When trying to come up with something to do as our project, we thought that a forum for the ECS students would be the most useful thing to do. The reason for this is that up until now, we had been using Facebook groups as an alternative to comminicate with our course-mates over course related issues. As a result, we thought that a forum designed for that purpose would be more structured and easier to use. We also tried to make other useful bits of information available through the forum that ECS students will most likely need, like the module explorer or the statistics of a module, to name a few. Students can also see the forums of past years, so that they may compare and see how a module has changed over the years.</p><h3>Functionality</h3><p> We have tried to make a number of things available and we incorporated functionality from websites like StackOverflow and Reddit that we found useful (marking a reply as the answer, or nested replying, to name some), as well as traditional forum functionality(like creating threads or categories).</p>
			<p>But, as mentioned before, although traditional forum functionality is there this application is not just a forum. </p>
			<p>Students can rate modules, lecturers and courseworks. This way, students can see how hard or interesting a module or a coursework is, and how it was different for each year. Also, giving information to the students by older students gives them further insight into what a module really is about, and that way students will have easier access to opinions of users who have already taken the module, rather than just the ECS pages or archives. We believe that this will give students of future years the chance to pick their modules more effortlessly and pick modules that suit them. <br/>
			Students can also subscribe to modules through RSS for receiving notifications about changes or posts for the modules that interest them.
